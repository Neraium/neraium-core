"""Relational instability and graph metrics.

Responsibilities:
- Relational stability (correlation frame-to-frame)
- Relational drift (relationship changes)
- Adjacency matrix and graph metrics
- Signal structural importance (per-node criticality)
- Subsystem spectral measures

Note: Delegates to existing geometry and graph modules.
This layer will grow as graph-based detection is enhanced.
