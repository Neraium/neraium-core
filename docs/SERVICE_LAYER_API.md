# Neraium Service Layer API (Production-Oriented v1)

This document defines the production service layer around the validated Neraium engine using **advisory operational recommendation semantics**.

## Canonical Output Contract

All service methods emit or persist one stable canonical envelope.

### Required fields

- `schema_version`: contract version string (`2026-03-28`)
- `timestamp`: frame timestamp
- `cycle`: per-run monotonic cycle index
- `attribution`
  - `top_drivers`: list of `{driver, score}`
  - `group_contributions`: optional grouped contributions
- `regime_memory`: regime-memory payload from engine
- `risk_assessment`
  - `risk_level`
  - `trend`
  - `latest_instability`
- `causal_analysis`: engine causal output
- `operational_recommendation`
  - `status.available`
  - `status.advisory` (always `true`)
  - `status.reason`
  - `recommended_action`
  - `recommended_target`
  - `priority`
  - `recommendation_confidence`
  - `urgency`
  - `rationale`
  - `supporting_evidence`
  - `operator_note`
- `confidence`: normalized [0,1] confidence view
- `explanation_text`: operator-facing explanation
- `events`: product-facing event flags

### Optional fields

- `session`: `{run_id, customer_id}`
- `aliases`: isolated compatibility aliases (`legacy_decision`, optional legacy `decision`, `explanation`, `regime_memory_state`)

## Operator boundary

Neraium recommendations are advisory outputs intended to support, not replace, qualified operator judgment and site-specific procedures.

## Service Interface

Implemented on `StructuralMonitoringService`:

- `ingest_frame(payload, *, run_id=None, customer_id=None)`
- `ingest_batch(payloads, *, run_id=None, customer_id=None)`
- `get_current_state(*, run_id=None, customer_id=None)`
- `get_recent_history(limit=100, *, run_id=None, customer_id=None)`
- `get_latest_recommendation(*, run_id=None, customer_id=None)`
- `get_latest_decision(*, run_id=None, customer_id=None)` (deprecated compatibility alias)
- `get_latest_explanation(*, run_id=None, customer_id=None)`
- `get_memory_matches(*, run_id=None, customer_id=None, site_id=None, asset_id=None, limit=20)`
- `get_pattern_history(*, customer_id=None, family_label=None, limit=100)`
- `get_novel_events(*, customer_id=None, run_id=None, limit=100)`

## Event Semantics

Events are derived from existing engine outputs:

- `early_instability_detected`: instability rises while risk not yet high
- `risk_escalated`: risk level increases vs previous cycle
- `recommendation_available`: advisory recommendation is available
- `inspection_recommended`: high risk or inspect/diagnose recommendation cues
- `deterioration_detected`: rising trend or instability jump
- `known_pattern_recalled`: nearest structural memory match found
- `novel_pattern_detected`: current pattern below conservative similarity/overlap thresholds
- `cross_asset_pattern_match`: nearest recalled match came from a different asset
- `recurring_degradation_pattern`: high-confidence recurring medium/high-risk degradation pattern

## Structural memory signature (deterministic)

The first-pass structural memory signature is compact and explainable:

- top attribution drivers (top 3 names)
- attribution concentration (`max_driver_abs_score / sum_abs_scores`)
- regime key (from regime memory labels/state)
- risk level + trend
- instability bucket (`latest_instability` normalized and clipped)
- decision state + action + derived action target token
- dominant hypothesis (from causal analysis dominant hypothesis/driver)
- confidence bucket

## Similarity and novelty

Similarity score is fully deterministic and interpretable:

- **categorical match score** across regime/risk/decision/hypothesis fields
- **driver overlap score** (Jaccard overlap of top drivers)
- **numeric closeness score** across concentration/instability/confidence buckets
- weighted total: `0.5 * categorical + 0.3 * driver_overlap + 0.2 * numeric`

Novelty is conservative:

- novel when either total similarity `< 0.72` **or** driver overlap `< 0.45`
- if no prior memory exists, mark novel with reason `no_prior_structural_memory`
- novelty reason always returned for traceability

## HTTP API Layer (FastAPI)
